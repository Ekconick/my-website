My JSC370 Final Project Website. The project discussed the factors that affect the house price.

The real estate markets, present an interesting opportunity for data analysts to analyze and predict
where property prices are moving towards. Prediction of property prices is becoming increasingly crucial,
offering valuable insights into both the broader market’s trajectory and the economic health of a nation.
This project tackles the classic problem of house price prediction using machine learning and statistical
methods, with a specific focus on identifying the key factors influencing housing prices in the United
States. Furthermore, we dive into a case study of Seattle, comparing the city’s housing market dynamics
to those of the broader national market, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors
affecting property prices at both local and national levels.

The datasets are from Kaggle, and can be found in the data folder.
